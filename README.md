# Eviivo Book App

## What's This About?

A simple app to help you keep track of your favourite books and authors. It has two tabs — one for adding books and another for authors — with nice touches like dropdown menus and validation to make sure you don’t miss anything important.  

It’s designed to work smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
